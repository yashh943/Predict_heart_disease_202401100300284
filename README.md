# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a labeled dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `4. Predict Heart Disease.csv`, which includes various medical features such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- ST depression
- And more...

**Target column:**  
- `0` → No heart disease  
- `1` → Heart disease present
