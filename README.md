Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease using a dataset of patient health information.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains 14 attributes for each patient:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Serum cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Resting electrocardiographic results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise induced angina

Oldpeak (depression induced by exercise relative to rest)

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

Number of vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

Target (Heart Disease Presence: 0 - No, 1 - Yes)
